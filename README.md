# gliding-ghost
Simple, minimalist WordPress theme with AJAX page loading and support for portfolio post types.

<strong>Languages:</strong> English, Espa√±ol

<p>This is my 8th WordPress theme release. Gliding Ghost is a simple, minimalist WordPress theme based on the <a href="http://tomcreighton.com/2012/10/glider-theme/" target="_blank">Glider</a> theme for WordPress and the <a href="http://roryg.github.io/ghostwriter/" target="_blank">Ghostwriter</a> theme for the Ghost CMS. This theme features ajax post loading, responsive design, support for portfolio post types, and more.</p

<p>The original inspiration for this WordPress theme comes from the Ghostwriter theme for the Ghost CMS. I was inspired and impressed by the theme&#8217;s simplicity, minimalism and animated transitions. I was frustrared, however, that I was unable to run Ghost CMS on my hosting. So I set out to port the theme over to WordPress.</p><p>Help in how to create an AJAX-loading theme came by way of Tom Creighton&#8217;s Glider theme for WordPress. The two combined to create Gliding Ghost &#8211; the free, lightweight WordPress theme you can download now!</p

<p>This theme uses the WordPress Theme Customizer to allow for changing the colors, menus and many other features of this theme.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> This is an old WordPress theme. I neither promise nor provide any support.
